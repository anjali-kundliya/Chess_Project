# Chess_Project
Here is my first ever project, which I have done during "The Uplift Project". In this, we have taken a sample PGN file which is used as an input and a sample FEN file is also there, which is created by implementing PGN file. I have created this project using Python and it's library called re(Regular Expression) only.
